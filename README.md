# First experience with react native, don't expect too much ;)

- I followed a tutorial and tried to separate the experience with the versions and commits, so if you want see the progress, it's more easy like that. On this experience I followed a tutorial, step by step like he did, just to know how react native is. The link of the tutorial is [here](### Link of the tutorial in YouTube; Obs: it's it Pt-Br).

### v. 0.0.1

- Version 0.0.1 add:

> 3 screen scopes, the MainStack file which will be the first one file to be loaded in execution of the application.

- Also in this version the standard app scope of react native has been used by start, like in the tutorial, and the dependencies has been installed.

### v. 0.10.0

- Version 0.10.0 add:

> loading and login screen completed, with their workflow running nicely.

- And also add assets, contexts, reducers and components folder.

### v.0.11.0

- This version add the rest of the tutorial, but the app still incomplete, the pages added are: 

> SignUp, Home, also added another pages, but they still incomplete. 

- The functionality added by me was just when the user clicks on the item of a barber that's been showing in home page, he will be redirected for the profile page too, the ideia is just too simple, but is my first time using react native and i'm starting with some practice so I choose stay with this for now.
